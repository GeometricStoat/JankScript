# JankScript
A Lua-like interpreter, but it's janky.

## Running locally
I don't know if this will work depending on the version of Java. I wrote it with version 14.0.1, but it might work for other versions. Just run the main file in an IDE or compile and run it in the command line (I can't get that to work). It might not work in any IDE other than Eclipse, so be ware.
